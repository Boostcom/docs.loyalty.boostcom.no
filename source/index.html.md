# Introduction

It's an API to manage loyalty club's members.
It can be accessed from both Boostcom's internal server applications as well as from native mobile applications as well as external client's server applications.

# Global settings

## Host

V1 & V2 API host is https://connect.bstcm.no/

## Content-Type

This API supports `application/json` only. 

Both payload and response body are supposed to be a valid JSON so when making a request send a `Content-Type: application/json` header.

If payload is not a valid JSON, then `406 Not Acceptable` HTTP code and empty response body are returned.

## Msisdn - member identifier

Members in our systems are identified with their phone numbers (msisdns) according to [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)
We use format without leading `00` or `+` and without spaces, so that it contains only digits, i.e. `4740485124`.

There is no special handling in case it has wrong format, except for creating a member and sending a token.
`404 Not Found` is returned and empty response body unless stated otherwise.

## Registration options

New members could be created with or without password confirmation depending on which token is being used on *Create member* action.

*Send token* action will trigger sending member token/password to provided msisdn no matter whether msisdn is already a member or not.

# Validation on members

All members' endpoints have properties validation. Properties are validated to conform loyalty club's schema.

If something is wrong, you will receive explanation of errors in response.

<aside class="warning">
Errors format and strings are not yet stable and may change without further notice.
</aside>

## Schema validation errors

```shell
curl -X PUT -H "X-Product-Name: custom-product-name" \
    -H "X-Customer-Private-Token: token" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
	"properties": {
		"first_name": "",
		"last_name": "err",
		"gender": "man",
		"birthday": "201X-01-01"
	}
}' "https://tbp.bstcm.no/api/v2/loyalty_clubs/:loyalty_club_slug/members/:msisdn"
```

> Example response (with code 400):

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "properties": {
      "birthday": [
        {
          "error": "invalid_date_format",
          "property": "birthday"
        }
      ],
      "gender": [
        {
          "error": "value_not_match",
          "property": "gender",
          "value": "man",
          "values": "Mann, Kvinne"
        }
      ],
      "first_name": [
        {
          "error": "not_contain_required_property",
          "property": "first_name"
        }
      ]
    }
